Hi! I'm a Software Engineer focused on building simple, efficient, and robust systems.

Most recently I worked for [SPINS](https://www.spins.com/)
on their Product Intelligence team. Before that, I worked for a startup called [Pinto](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pinto-9c15) which was acquired by SPINS.
And before that, I began my career at Wakefern Food Corp. in their CISD department
working accross several teams - Business Intelligence, Mobile Applications, and Finance.

Most of my professional experience has been working with TypeScript as a Full Stack Engineer. Although I have worked extensively with
Go and Python on various projects. While I enjoy working across the stack,
my strengths lean toward backend infrastructure, distributed systems, and developer tooling.

I’ve worked on systems that span cloud infrastructure, microservices, and custom developer tools — from optimizing large-scale MongoDB queries
to implementing automated documentation. I prefer dependency-light, observable systems that are easy to understand and are robust.

Outside of work, I like to explore focused projects that help me explore and better understand topics I am interested in.
Currently I am learning Rust which I am very much enjoying. To faciliate my learning experience, I am currently implementing a [POP3
server and client](https://github.com/cnrmurphy/pop3-rs). Implementing an RFC is a great project to learn a new language!
I have also implemented a simple [Key/Value Database in Go](https://github.com/cnrmurphy/voila),
a [b+ tree in JavaScript](https://github.com/cnrmurphy/B-Plus-Tree), and my own fully automated trading system in Go (I will release an article on this at some point).

Outside of programming, I also enjoy running, hiking, and tinkering with music. I have run 3 half-maratons and hope to run a full marathon as well as an ultra marathon.
