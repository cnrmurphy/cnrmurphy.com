# About

Hi! My name is Conor. I am a Software Engineer by trade, but also enjoy things like tinkering with music, running, hiking, and cycling.

## Programming
I took an interest in programming over two decades ago now! Toward the end of my Elementary school years, around 2002, I began to learn to program
driven by an interest in computer security and video games. The first language I learned was C, but I quickly hit a wall at which point I discovered
Python. Back then there was a great wiki book available on the official Python website. This enabled me to better understand how programming work.

These days I am interested in backend development. I prefer to work in Go and Rust. I am also quite interested in databases and  database development.
You can take a look at my experience on my <https://cnrmurphy.com/resume> (if you are connected via TCP, use command `resume`).

## Running
I ran track and cross-country in high school and middle school respectivly. I hated it. But a few months before Covid was a thing, I decided I should
try to run since I was sitting all day at work. Six months later I ran my first half-marathon. Then I ran a second, and a third. As it turns out, I quite
like running and I think I'm half decent at it (as would surprise my younger self). I also enjoy running in "barefoot sandals" which are a form of
minimalist running gear. These are basically flat sandals that don't have much padding between your feet and the ground. I hear there are some benefits to
running in these. For instance, they help restore your natural gait, force you to use proper running technique, and make your legs and feet strong (this makes the most sense to me).
Apart from the last claim, I'm not sure how true the rest are, but I **do** find these sandals fun and challenging to run in so that is good enough for me! Hopefully one day
I will run a full marathon and even an ultra marathon.

## Cycling
Cycling to me is everything I love about running minus the bad parts. What I enjoy most about long-distance running is the "travelling" aspect of it. It makes me feel good
and allows me to see new things; even gaining new perspectives on spaces I have existed in for a long time. But cycling allows me to travel further. While I do love the grit
of running, it can be quite strenuous so I appreciate that cycling can give me the same things I enjoy without as much strain.

## Hiking
I don't actually have much to say about hiking - I just enjoy being out in nature and hiking is a great way to spend time outside exploring and often more social than my other hobbies as it is accessibe for others.

## Music
I enjoy music a lot and deeply, but listen to a lot of the same stuff I always have. Pat Metheny (Group), Boards of Canada, Aphex Twin, Autechre.
I mainly listen to Pat Metheny. I noodle around on my Strandberg guitar and I am interested in electronic music and messing with modular synthesis.
